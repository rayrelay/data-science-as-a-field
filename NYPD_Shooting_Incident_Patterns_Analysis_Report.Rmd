# NYPD Shooting Incident Patterns Analysis

## 1. Data Import

### About the Dataset

This dataset tracks all shooting incidents reported in New York City from 2013 up to the latest complete year. The data is updated quarterly and carefully reviewed by the NYPD's Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being published. Each entry captures important information about a shooting event: when and where it happened, who was involved, and whether it was fatal. It also includes demographic details about both victims and suspects. This information helps researchers, the public, and policy makers analyze patterns in gun violence across the city.

```{r data_import}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
library(scales) 

# Import CSV data directly from NYC Open Data platform
url <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
shootings <- read_csv(url) 

# Examine data structure

## 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

```{r data_cleaning}
# Rename columns and prepare temporal features
shootings_clean <- shootings %>%

    occurrence_time = `OCCUR_TIME`,
    borough = `BORO`,
    precinct = `PRECINCT`,
    jurisdiction = `JURISDICTION_CODE`,
    fatal = `STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG`,
    location_type = `LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC`,
    vic_age = `VIC_AGE_GROUP`
  ) %>%
  mutate(occurrence_date = mdy(occurrence_date),
         year = year(occurrence_date),
         month = month(occurrence_date, label = TRUE),

### Statistical Model: Logistic Regression for Fatal Outcomes

```{r model}
# Prepare data for logistic regression
model_data <- shootings_clean %>%
  mutate(
    fatal_flag = ifelse(fatal == "TRUE", 1, 0),
    victim_age = factor(VIC_AGE_GROUP,

                       ordered = FALSE),
    weekend = ifelse(weekday %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "Weekend", "Weekday")
  ) %>%
  select(fatal_flag, borough, victim_age, VIC_SEX, time_of_day, location_category, weekend)

# Fit logistic regression model for fatal outcome probability

  ))

# Display model summary
model_table <- model_summary %>%

```

## 5. Bias Analysis

### Potential Sources of Bias

1.  **Reporting Bias**:
    -   Non-fatal incidents may be underreported compared to fatal ones
    -   Variations in police reporting practices across precincts
2.  **Demographic Bias**:
    -   Suspect information has significantly higher missing rates than victim data
    -   Limited granularity in race/ethnicity categories
3.  **Temporal Bias**:
    -   Data excludes incidents where exact time wasn't recorded
    -   Historical data quality may differ from recent records
4.  **Location Bias**:
    -   "Street" category may be overrepresented due to vague reporting
    -   Private locations may be underreported
5.  **Model Limitations**:
    -   Logistic regression doesn't capture complex interactions between variables
    -   Some age groups have limited sample sizes

### Bias Mitigation Strategies

```{r bias_mitigation}
# Calculate missing data rates
missing_rates <- shootings_clean %>%
  summarise(
    `Perpetrator Age` = mean(is.na(PERP_AGE_GROUP) | PERP_AGE_GROUP == "UNKNOWN") * 100,
    `Perpetrator Race` = mean(is.na(PERP_RACE) | PERP_RACE == "UNKNOWN") * 100,
    `Location Description` = mean(is.na(location_type) | location_type == "OTHER") * 100
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Missing Rate (%)") %>%
  mutate(`Missing Rate (%)` = round(`Missing Rate (%)`, 1))

# Print compact table
cat("Missing Data Rates for Key Fields:\n")
cat("---------------------------------\n")
cat(sprintf("%-25s %s\n", "Variable", "Missing Rate (%)"))
cat("---------------------------------\n")
for(i in 1:nrow(missing_rates)) {
  row <- missing_rates[i, ]
  cat(sprintf("%-25s %.1f%%\n", row$Variable, row$`Missing Rate (%)`))
}
```

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings:

1.  **Spatial Patterns**:
    -   65% of incidents occur in patrol jurisdictions
    -   Top 10 precincts (all in Brooklyn/Bronx) account for 28% of all incidents
    -   72% of incidents occur in street locations
2.  **Temporal Patterns**:
    -   Nighttime accounts for 52% of all incidents
    -   Weekends show 18% higher incident rates than weekdays
    -   2020-2021 saw 34% increase in incidents compared to previous period
3.  **Victim Profiles**:
    -   91% of victims are male
    -   Highest fatality rates among elderly victims (65+ age group)
4.  **Fatal Outcome Model**:
    -   Victims 65+ have 3.2x higher odds of fatal outcome compared to minors (OR=3.21, p\<0.001)
    -   Staten Island shows 1.8x higher fatal outcome rate than Brooklyn (OR=1.81, p\<0.001)
    -   Male victims have 1.4x higher fatal outcome odds than females (OR=1.41, p\<0.001)

### Recommendations:

1.  **Targeted Patrols**: Increase nighttime patrols in high-risk precincts during weekends
2.  **Elderly Protection**: Develop community safety programs for elderly residents in high-risk areas
3.  **Location Interventions**: Implement street lighting improvements in high-incident corridors
4.  **Data Quality**: Improve perpetrator data collection through standardized reporting protocols
5.  **Prevention Programs**: Create gender-specific violence prevention programs targeting young males
